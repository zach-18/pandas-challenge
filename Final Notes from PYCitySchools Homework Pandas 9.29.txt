Project Selected = Option 2: PyCitySchools

Project File Name = PyCitySchools.ipynb

Two Observable Trends:
- Scores by School Size:  The larger the school, the lower the math score.  (83.8 (Small) to 77.1 (Very Large).
- Scores by Budget Size:  The % Passing Reading was higher for low Budget total schools (92.7%) vs. 
			  Very High Budget schools (78.6%).

Overall Comments:  
- I liked this exercise, I simply ran out of time with work to finish every required table. 
- Most of it I was able to figure out via class material, activities, and Google.
- I struggled with measuring the % Passing Math / Reading.  My tutor helped me on Monday night.
- However, I while the tutor helped me measure those numbers, I was unable to add them to my df table.
